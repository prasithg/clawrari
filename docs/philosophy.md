Why Clawrari makes the choices it does.

## Your AI Should Have a Personality

A blank-slate assistant is a search engine with extra steps. Clawrari ships with strong defaults: opinions, humor, directness. You can tune the dial, but "no personality" isn't an option.

Why? Because you'll actually use an assistant you enjoy talking to. The ones that say "Great question!" get abandoned within a week.

## Memory Is Not Optional

Most AI setups treat memory as an afterthought. Clawrari treats it as the foundation. Without memory:
- Every conversation starts from zero
- Your AI can't learn your patterns
- You repeat yourself constantly
- There's no compounding intelligence

The memory system (daily logs + structured files + semantic search) ensures your AI gets smarter every day.

## Opinionated > Flexible

Clawrari doesn't give you 47 options for how to structure your workspace. It gives you THE structure — the one that's been tested in production for months.

You can customize after setup. But the defaults should be good enough that most people never need to.

## Proactive > Reactive

A great assistant doesn't wait to be asked. It:
- Prepares your morning briefing before you wake up
- Preps context before your meetings
- Flags problems before they become fires
- Suggests actions based on patterns it's noticed

This requires cron jobs, memory, and a personality that takes initiative. Clawrari sets up all three.

## Errors Are Bugs

When a cron job fails, most setups log it and move on. Clawrari treats it as a bug to fix immediately. Your AI should be annoyed by broken things, because you are.

## Build in Public

Every optimization is a potential post. Every new capability is a tutorial. Clawrari isn't just a setup — it's a content engine for sharing what you've learned about working with AI.
