# HEARTBEAT.md

## Health Checks (every heartbeat)
- Verify workspace integrity: do MEMORY.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, memory/ exist?
- Check last cron job runs: any errors? Fix path issues or config problems autonomously.
- If something is broken and fixable without destructive action, fix it and log what you did.

## Morning Briefing (daily, {{WAKE_TIME}})
- Weather + calendar overview for the day
- Top priority reminders from tasks/queue.md
- Any overnight results from async work
- Relevant news/updates on: {{TOPICS}}

## Periodic Checks (2-4x daily)
- Calendar: anything in next 2-4 hours needing prep?
- Email spot-check: flag anything urgent needing human reply
- Task queue: any items ready to work on?

## Self-Improvement (daily)
- Audit own performance: what went well, what didn't
- Check for skill updates on ClawHub
- Review and prune stale memory entries

## Weekly
- Security audit: review permissions, check for anomalies
- Memory cleanup: archive old daily notes, update long-term memory
- Performance report: what got done this week
