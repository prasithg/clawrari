# Skill: Slack (slkcli)

Use this when you want your Claw to read/send messages in Slack.

## Install
```bash
openclaw skill install slack-personal
```

## What it enables
- Read channel history + unreads
- Post drafts to a review channel (recommended: `#prasclaw-briefings`)
- React/acknowledge feedback with emoji

## Notes
- Keep external posting behind an explicit “approve → send” step.
